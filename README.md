# FlameUI [C++ UI Library]

Aim is to make a User Interface Library which will be super efficient and fast.

### **Important: This project is not matured or meant to be actually used by a user to integrate in his/her own project. I made this project when I was quite young so this repository is here to showcase what I did, and not a production ready user interface library.**

### For single config generators like MakeFiles, Ninja:

Use cmake while specifying the value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` cmake variable to be either `Debug` or `Release`

Example: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <path/to/source>`
If not provided with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, default build configuration selected will be `Debug`

<hr>

_Developer Note: Yet to test build process on Windows. Library currently under development._
